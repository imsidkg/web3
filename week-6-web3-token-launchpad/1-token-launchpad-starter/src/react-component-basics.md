# React Component Basics Checklist

- [ ] Understand that a React component is a function or a class that returns JSX.
- [ ] Know that function components must have a `return` statement for the JSX they should render.
- [ ] Remember that JSX returned by a component must have a single root element (e.g., everything wrapped in one `<div>` or a fragment `<>`).
- [ ] Learn about JSX syntax and how it differs from HTML (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).
